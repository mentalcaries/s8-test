**Images**

I used the images provided to me in a separate folder and imported them to the webpage.
Images consisted of different outdoor parks and some national parks.

I also downloaded icons and special characters needed from the Figma content provided.

**Functionality**

- This webpage uses some media queries to make sure the page layout conforms to different screen sizes.
- There are hover elements that change the appearance of the add button, edit button, and like icon (heart icon).
